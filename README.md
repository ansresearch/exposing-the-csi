# Exposing the CSI (dataset)

This repository will soon contain the links to the dataset + additional resources (e.g., ground-truth videos) for the paper:

Marco Cominelli, Francesco Gringoli, Francesco Restuccia, *Exposing the CSI: A Systematic Investigation of CSI-based Wi-Fi Sensing Capabilities and Limitations*

## Dataset

We split our dataset into multiple repositories hosted on Zenodo.
Each repository has size of approx 11 GB and contains the CSI data of a different scenario, from S1 to S7.

* [Scenario S1](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7732595)
* [Scenario S2](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7732781)
* [Scenario S3](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7751893)
* [Scenario S4](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7751897)
* [Scenario S5](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7751907)
* [Scenario S6](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7751909)
* [Scenario S7](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7751915)

**The ground truth with 3D models will be available on GitHub very soon. If you need the data now, please contact: marco.cominelli@unibs.it**

## Main features

The dataset contains CSI sequences collected in indoor environments while a target person performs different activities. The main features of the dataset are the following:

* 12 target activities, 80 seconds for each activity
* 7 different scenarios (3 people, 3 environments)
* CSI collected using 160-MHz 802.11ax devices with 4 antennas
* 3 Wi-Fi receivers collecting the same frames in different locations
* anonymized video ground-truth
