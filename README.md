# Exposing the CSI (dataset)

This repository will soon contain the links to the dataset + additional resources (e.g., ground-truth videos) for the paper:

Marco Cominelli, Francesco Gringoli, Francesco Restuccia, *Exposing the CSI: A Systematic Investigation of CSI-based Wi-Fi Sensing Capabilities and Limitations*

## Main features

The dataset contains CSI sequences collected in indoor environments while a target person performs different activities. The main features of the dataset are the following:

* 12 target activities, 80 seconds for each activity
* 7 different scenarios (3 people, 3 environments)
* CSI collected using 160-MHz 802.11ax devices with 4 antennas
* 3 Wi-Fi receivers collecting the same frames in different locations
* anonymized video ground-truth

**Our complete dataset will be publicly available on Zenodo very soon. If you need the dataset right now, please contact: marco.cominelli@unibs.it**
